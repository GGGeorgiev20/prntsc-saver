## 👀 About
This is a script written in Python, which allows you to save random images from the site https://prnt.sc/. All images from the script go into a folder named images. The process might be quite slow due to the excess amount of empty and excluded images.

## 🔒 Exclude
All images in the exclude folder will not go in to the output folder. You can even add your own images!

##  ❗ Warning
The images are obtained online from a site, which can be used by anyone and is not moderated. The content can be inappropriate and not safe for work. Use at your own risk!

## 🕹️ How to use
To use the script make sure you have python installed. If you don't, click on the python icon. If you do, you need to go into command prompt and type `pip install {module}`. The modules you need are `opencv-python`, `requests`, `pathlib` and `pillow`. Once you've done that, just open the folder in cmd and type `python main.py` or if you want to, you can do the same in vscode.
